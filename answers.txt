Q2: What fields could data science be applied to? Give an example at how it might help.

Answer: Data science is very important for banks, as they have a large amount of data on their customers that they can use to make business decisions. A bank may be concerned with how well their branches are performing, so they can use data science to see which bank branches have lots of customers and which ones don't.

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merge ties together another branch with the current branch that you are on. So we take the merging branch and combine it with our main one. Rebasing will move the merging branch onto the end of the main branch. This will make also make your project history more linear, as there will be no branches moving in and out from the main branch.
