Q2: What fiels could data science be applied to? Give an example at how it might help.

Answer: Data science is very important for banks, as they have a large amount of data on their customers that they can use to make business decisions. A bank may be concerned with how well their branches are performing, so they can use data science to see which bank branches have lots of customers and which ones don't.
